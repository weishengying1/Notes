# Python asyncio Usage Guide

`asyncio` is a Python library for writing concurrent code, especially suitable for I/O-intensive tasks (e.g., network requests, file operations) and less suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. Below is a guide on how to define coroutine functions, create tasks, and run asynchronous tasks in an event loop.

## 1. Defining a Coroutine Function

In `asyncio`, an asynchronous function needs to be defined using the `async def` keyword. Within a coroutine function, `await` can be used to call other asynchronous functions.

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming operation
    print("World")
```

## 2. Creating and Running a Coroutine Task

You can use `asyncio.run()` to directly run a top-level coroutine:

```python
asyncio.run(say_hello())
```

In this case, Python will automatically create and run the event loop.

## 3. Running Multiple Coroutines Concurrently

You can use `asyncio.gather()` to run multiple coroutines concurrently and wait for all of them to complete:

```python
async def say(message, delay):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(message)

async def main():
    # Run two coroutines concurrently
    await asyncio.gather(
        say("Hello", 2),
        say("World", 1)
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

In the code above, `say("Hello", 2)` and `say("World", 1)` run concurrently, and "World" is printed before "Hello" because it has a shorter delay.

## 4. Creating Tasks and Manual Management

Using `asyncio.create_task()`, you can create task objects to manage coroutines. The tasks will automatically run in the event loop.

```python
async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(say("Hello", 2))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(say("World", 1))
    
    # Wait for tasks to complete
    await task1
    await task2

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 5. Handling Asynchronous Results

Using `await` to wait for a coroutine to complete allows you to directly get the return value:

```python
async def add(a, b):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return a + b

async def main():
    result = await add(3, 4)
    print("Result:", result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The examples above are basic `asyncio` usages, commonly applied in scenarios that require concurrent I/O operations. `asyncio` is an efficient choice when you need to switch control among tasks and save execution time.
